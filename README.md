🛒 SuperMarket – Management System
📌 Overview

SuperMarket is a desktop supermarket management system built using C# and .NET Framework (Windows Forms).

This project was developed to strengthen my programming fundamentals, backend logic, database design, and architectural skills.
The main goal was not only to build a working system, but to deeply understand advanced database and .NET concepts in a real-world scenario.

🏗 Architecture

The application is built using a 3-Tier Architecture:

Presentation Layer (Windows Forms UI)

Business Logic Layer (BLL)

Data Access Layer (DAL)

This separation improves:

Maintainability

Scalability

Code organization

Testability

Data access is implemented using ADO.NET.

🛠 Technologies Used

C#

.NET Framework (Windows Forms)

ADO.NET

SQL Server

3-Tier Architecture

Visual Studio

🗄 Database Technologies & Concepts

The project heavily focuses on advanced SQL Server features:

Stored Procedures

Scalar Functions

Table-Valued Functions

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Views

AFTER Triggers

Transactions 

These were implemented to ensure:

Data consistency

Business rule enforcement

Performance optimization

Clean database design

💡 Programming Concepts Applied

To strengthen my fundamentals, I intentionally implemented many core concepts:

Events & Delegates

Async / Await

Multithreading

Serialization & Deserialization

Transactions Handling

Collections (List<T>)

Exception Handling

Layered Architecture Design

The goal was to move beyond basic CRUD and understand how systems behave internally.

🚀 Key Features

Product Management

Category Management

Customer Management

Sales & Billing System

Data validation and transaction-safe operations

Database-triggered logic for integrity enforcement

🎯 Project Purpose

This project was built to:

Improve logical thinking and problem-solving

Strengthen database knowledge

Practice advanced SQL concepts

Understand multithreading and async behavior

Apply clean architecture principles

Gain real experience with ADO.NET

It represents my growth in backend and desktop application development.
